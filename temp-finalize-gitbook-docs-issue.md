# Finalize GitBook Documentation Migration

### Action Plan: Finalize GitBook Documentation

1. **Full Content Review**
- [ ] Read through all docs in the `docs/` directory.
- [ ] Check for any TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete sections.
- [ ] Ensure all new/updated features (e.g., Zod, testing, pipeline, integrations) are documented and indexed.

2. **Navigation & Linking**
- [ ] Verify that every major doc is included in `docs/SUMMARY.md` (GitBook navigation).
- [ ] Check that all internal links (e.g., `[Next: ...]`, cross-references) work and point to the correct files.
- [ ] Ensure "Next"/"Previous" pointers are consistent and logical.

3. **Formatting & Style**
- [ ] Confirm consistent use of headings, code blocks, lists, and callouts.
- [ ] Ensure code examples are up to date and copy-pasteable.
- [ ] Remove any legacy formatting or non-GitBook-friendly elements.

4. **GitBook-Specific Configuration (if needed)**
- [ ] Add or update `book.json` or `.gitbook.yaml` if using advanced GitBook features (optional).
- [ ] Set up custom theme, plugins, or branding if desired.

5. **Local Preview**
- [ ] Use GitBook's local preview (or a Markdown previewer) to check navigation, formatting, and link integrity.
- [ ] Fix any issues found during preview.

6. **Deployment**
- [ ] Push the latest docs to the main branch (or the branch connected to GitBook).
- [ ] If not already done, connect the repo to GitBook and trigger a build/publish.
- [ ] Verify the live GitBook site renders as expected.

7. **Final Checklist**
- [ ] All docs are present, up to date, and navigable.
- [ ] No broken links or missing sections.
- [ ] All new features and workflows are documented.
- [ ] GitBook site is live and matches the repo.

8. **Close the Issue**
- [ ] Add a comment to Issue #19 summarizing the completion steps.
- [ ] Close the issue!
