# Best Practices

Follow these best practices to get the most out of PEDAL and ensure reliable, maintainable workflows.

## Workflow Design

### Keep Workflows Focused
- Design workflows for a single, clear purpose
- Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable components
- Use descriptive names that explain what the workflow does

### Error Handling
- Always include error handling and retry logic
- Use conditional steps to handle different scenarios
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

### Dependencies
- Minimize dependencies between workflows
- Use explicit dependency declarations
- Avoid circular dependencies

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- Use environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Keep configuration in version control when possible
- Use different configs for different environments

### Secrets Management
- Never hardcode secrets in workflow definitions
- Use PEDAL's built-in secrets management
- Rotate secrets regularly

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Usage
- Monitor workflow execution time and resource consumption
- Optimize slow steps or consider parallelization
- Clean up temporary files and artifacts

### Caching
- Cache expensive operations when possible
- Use PEDAL's built-in caching features
- Invalidate caches when dependencies change

## Security

### Access Control
- Use least-privilege access for workflows
- Regularly review and update permissions
- Audit workflow access and execution logs

### Input Validation
- Validate all external inputs
- Use PEDAL's schema validation features
- Sanitize data before processing

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- Use structured logging with consistent formats
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Set appropriate log levels

### Metrics
- Track key performance indicators
- Monitor workflow success rates
- Set up alerts for critical failures

## Testing

### Workflow Testing
- Test workflows with realistic data
- Include negative test cases
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Test workflows end-to-end
- Verify integration with external systems
- Test rollback and recovery procedures

## Documentation

### Workflow Documentation
- Document the purpose and expected behavior of each workflow
- Include examples and use cases
- Keep documentation up to date with changes

### Code Comments
- Add comments for complex logic
- Explain business rules and requirements
- Document assumptions and limitations

## Team Collaboration

### Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Review workflow changes before deployment
- Tag releases for important changes

### Communication
- Notify team members of workflow changes
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Share knowledge and lessons learned
