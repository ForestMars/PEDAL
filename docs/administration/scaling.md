# Scaling PEDAL

PEDAL is designed to scale from small teams to large enterprises.

## Horizontal Scaling
- Run multiple FastAPI instances behind a load balancer (e.g., nginx, HAProxy)
- Use container orchestration (Docker Compose, Kubernetes)

## Database Scaling
- Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for production
- Set up replication and backups for high availability

## Caching
- Use Redis for API response and workflow state caching
- Improve performance for large-scale deployments
