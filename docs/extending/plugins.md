# Plugin Development (Roadmap)

PEDAL will support plugins for advanced extensibility.

## Architecture
- Plugins can hook into workflow events and extend PEDAL's core
- Plugin lifecycle: install, activate, update, remove

## Creating a Plugin
- Boilerplate and packaging guidelines (coming soon)
- Use PEDAL's plugin API to register hooks

## Publishing
- Publish to the PEDAL plugin registry (planned)
- Share plugins with the community

## Example: AWS Lambda Deployment Plugin
- Automate deployment to AWS Lambda as a plugin
