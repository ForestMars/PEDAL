# Coding

PEDAL streamlines the coding phase with automation and integrations.

## Scaffolding
- Generate project structures (e.g., `pedal scaffold python`)
- Use templates for common architectures

## Git Integration
- Automate commits, pushes, and PR creation
- Sync with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

## Code Quality
- Linting and static analysis hooks (e.g., flake8, mypy)
- Enforce code standards in workflows
