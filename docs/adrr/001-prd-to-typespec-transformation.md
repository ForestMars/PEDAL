# ADR-001: PRD to TypeSpec Transformation Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on the approach for transforming Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into TypeSpec model files. This is a critical architectural decision that will impact the entire pipeline.

## Decision

We will implement a two-step transformation process:

1. PRD → AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
2. AST → TypeSpec

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of concerns between parsing and generation
- Structured intermediate representation for validation
- Better error handling and reporting at each stage
- More flexible for future transformations
- Easier to validate PRD structure
- Enables reuse for other outputs (OpenAPI, GraphQL, docs, visualizations)

### Negative

- Additional complexity in the pipeline
- Need to maintain AST schema
- Extra transformation step

## Implementation Notes

- Define AST schema as our intermediate representation
- Implement PRD parser to generate AST
- Create AST to TypeSpec transformer
- Add validation at each stage
- Version the AST schema to support evolution
