## Status Update: Remaining Work for Zod Schema Generation

Based on the current codebase analysis, here's what remains to be completed for the Zod Schema Generation feature:

### 1. Improve Type Safety
**Current Status:** Basic type mapping exists (string, number, boolean, array, object)
**Remaining Work:**
- Add support for complex types: enums, unions, nested objects, arrays of objects
- Implement proper TypeScript type inference and validation
- Add support for custom Zod types and refinements
- Handle OpenAPI schema references and circular dependencies
- Implement proper type coercion and validation

### 2. Enhance Validation Rules
**Current Status:** Basic required/optional field support
**Remaining Work:**
- Add Zod validation methods: `.min()`, `.max()`, `.regex()`, `.email()`, etc.
- Implement cross-field validation and conditional validation
- Add support for custom validation functions
- Handle OpenAPI format specifications (email, uri, date-time, etc.)
- Add support for pattern validation and constraints

### 3. Add Comprehensive Testing
**Current Status:** No dedicated test suite exists
**Remaining Work:**
- Create unit tests for all Zod generation functions
- Add integration tests for end-to-end pipeline scenarios
- Implement golden file testing for regression testing
- Add test coverage for error cases and edge cases
- Create performance tests for large schemas
- Add CI/CD integration for automated testing

### 4. Document Schema Patterns
**Current Status:** Basic ADR exists, but no user-facing documentation
**Remaining Work:**
- Create user documentation for generated schemas
- Document best practices and usage patterns
- Add examples for common validation scenarios
- Create developer guide for extending/customizing schemas
- Document migration path from current implementation

### Additional Technical Debt:
- Refactor the current `generateZodSchema` functions to use shared core logic
- Implement the hybrid approach (file-based + object-based) as outlined in ADR-003
- Add proper error handling and validation for malformed inputs
- Improve performance for large schemas
- Add support for schema versioning and evolution

### Priority Order:
1. **Testing** (foundation for all other work)
2. **Type Safety** (core functionality)
3. **Validation Rules** (user value)
4. **Documentation** (adoption and maintenance)

This work will significantly improve the robustness, usability, and maintainability of the Zod schema generation feature.
